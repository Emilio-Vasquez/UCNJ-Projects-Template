UCNJ-Projects-Template/
├── Template/ # Flask starter project (HTML, CSS, JS, Python)
├── docs/ # Instructional files for Computer Science and Database classes
└── README.md # This file
```

## **How to Use**

- Use the `Template/` folder to **kickstart your web project** — it includes base HTML, routing, static files, and a virtual environment guide.
- Refer to the `docs/` folder for **project instructions and guides** related to Python, Flask, SQL, and full-stack development.
- Clone the repository and duplicate or rename the `Template/` folder for each new project.

## **Notes**

- The `Template/VirtualEnv` folder includes a `README.md` with setup instructions for creating and managing virtual environments.
- `.gitignore` is already configured to skip virtual environments and sensitive `.env` files.
- You’re free to customize the starter files and instructional documents as needed for your class or project.
