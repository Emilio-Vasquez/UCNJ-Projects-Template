**Data Science Final Project**

**Backend:** Python (Flask)  
**Frontend:** JavaScript (Simple JS is fine, no need for React or Node.js)  
**Data Sources:** Public APIs and/or CSV files  
**Email Sender (Optional):** Google SMTP

**Project Objective:**  
Create a Full-Stack application that demonstrates your understanding of the data science lifecycle. The app should use real-world data from APIs or CSV files, implement a statistical or machine learning model, and present results through a clean, interactive interface.

**Data Ingestion, Cleaning, and Exploration (20 points):**

* Collect data via API or CSV upload (must identify and cite the source)  
* Clean and preprocess the dataset using Pandas and NumPy  
* Display at least 3 visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn  
* Provide descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, correlation matrix)

**Model Development (25 points):**

* Implement one model: Regression, Classification, Clustering, or Time-Series Forecasting  
* Use Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, or Statsmodels  
* Evaluate the model (Accuracy, RMSE, MAE, R\_square, Confusion Matrix, etc…)  
* Visualize model performance (Prediction vs Actual, validation data set, clusters, ROC curve, etc…)

**Full-Stack Integration (40 points):**

* Create a Flask Application that includes:  
  * A homepage with project overview  
  * If you are NOT using APIs: A form where the user can input data or upload a CSV  
  * If you are using APIs: A form where a user can input a specific name/ticker/number to get a dynamic call using the API and mapping it to that specific name/ticker/number.  
  * A results page showing model predictions and visualizations  
* Integrate JS to Enhance Interactivity (dropdowns, charts, etc…)  
* Deployable from localhost to GitHub

**Analytical Tools and Output (20 points):**

* In the App include at least 3 of the following:  
  * Feature Importance Chart  
  * Filterable Dataset Table  
  * Time-Series Visualization  
  * Confusion Matrix or Regression Residual Plot  
  * Cluster Map or Dendrogram  
  * Interactive Plot (using Plotly)

**Explainability and Reporting (15 points):**

* Explain what the model is doing in clear, student-written language  
* Include written interpretation of the results in the app or a README  
* Share 5 custom insights discovered in your data (correlation, outliers, feature effects, etc…)

**Collaboration and Presentation (20 points):**

* All group members must contribute via GItHub (use commit logs to keep track of contributions)  
* Use clear code structure, with comments and meaningful variable names  
* Final GitHub repo must include:  
  * ‘[README.md](http://README.md)’ explaining your project, data and model  
  * Screenshots of the Web App  
  * Sample outputs or test data  
* In-Class presentation must:  
  * Walk through your code structure  
  * Explain the model logic  
  * Demonstrate the app functionality

**Extra Credit (5 points each):**

* Add login/registration to personalize user experience  
* Add email notification feature using SMTP  
* Include downloadable PDF report or CSV of predictions

**Total Points: 140 points \+ 15 extra points**

**Due Date: N/A**

**Presentation: In class during Week 15**
